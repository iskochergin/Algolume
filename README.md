## Website - https://algolume.ru
The website contains theoretical information about algorithms and their visualization.
There is an opportunity for you to run the example code or visualize **your own one!** 

If you decide to visualize your code, you can point the needed names of variables specifically in your code. 
Then the engine of python returns the execution trace of the code and js script builds visualization for the algorithm you have chosen.

> You can simply access our Python debugging system by https://algolume.ru/debug and try to debug any python code you have)

By this moment there are 4 algorithms available:
- DP (Turtle task)
- DP (Grasshopper task)
- DFS
- BFS
- Dijkstra's
